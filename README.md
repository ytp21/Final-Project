# CS50 Final Project (Capstone): Stock Planner
## Overview
Stock Planner is a trading journal site which allows users, who register for free profile, to record trading acvitities by first creating stock watchlist and then adding entries and exits. For any added or deleted entry, Stock Planner will automatically calculates trading performance such as net-worth and profit/loss. Stock Planner also provides the basic info on stock performance such as market price, previous close, day range, market cap, average volume, P/E Ratio and Dividend Yield.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity
Stock Planner is a website that is completely different compare to the previous projects in terms of theme (trading journal), functionality (allowing users to add any stock into watchlist, adding and delete trade entry, viewing trade and stock performance) and designs (provides better user interface in terms of flexibility and viewing experience). This website is designed to be mobile-responsive, which no matter the size of your display, it will blend with your screen nicely and thus allow user to better control the website in any device. To ensure it is accessible to everyone, Stock Planner is uploaded and deployed on heroku server, where it can be run using this link - https://tp-tradeplanner.herokuapp.com/.
